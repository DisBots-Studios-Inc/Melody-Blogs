# Hosted!
---
As you guys know this website is now hosted up on Github pages!
that means you can now access this. So, from now on all updates for the
**Melody discord bot** and eventually other projects and bots will be posted here.

To be honest with you I never saw the Melody discord bot going past the prototype stage, but now 
here we are! Now for some big news v0.3.0b rc 1 is almost ready and will be released very shortly for testing
and the bot is getting closer to v1.0. Quick run-down of all the features to be expected in v1.0:
```
1. Music commands
2. Botinfo
3. Help
4. Github (shows github link)
5. Trello (shows trello page link)
6. database
7. queue
8. graphical duration, name and other stuff in play command
9. playlist command
10. documentation (shows documentation link)
11. on top.gg
```
Doing all of this however will take a long time to do. But in time we will complete it!
