# Incremental updates
---
This is a very small release, I mean it only 3 features were added such as:
```
1. Switched command framework to sdcf4j
2. Dynamic help command
3. Bug Fixes
```

## What does this mean?
---
let's go step by step!

* The first update (switching of command handlers) is actually quite internal, it adds support for a command framework known as sdcf4j. This gives a lot of freedom for, mainly help commands. You won't notice a change from your end though.
* The second update (Dynamic help command) on the other hand is something that you will notice! It is made possible by sdcf4j. The name is self-explanatory, Melody now has a help menu that updates automatically with commands.
* A lot of bug fixes. Small things like colors and text typos and such.
