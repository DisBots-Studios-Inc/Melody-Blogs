# Major release v0.1.1b! (The foundation update!)
---
This is a game breaking release! Many new features were added such as:
```
1. added Flexibility
2. Fixing of a lot of Bugs
3. Cleaner code
4. added Logger
5. Color files (utilities for color pallet and more)
6. improved BotInfo command
7. Improved UpTime command
9. Stabalized the bot
10. Added Github command that displays the github link of the bot
```
Most of these features you will not notice, because they are the foundation for later updates and features. Now the bot is also configurable with the token. That means now you can set the token to your own!
Documentation for the same will be out soon. But for this post here is how you do it üòâ

## Steps to configure the bot to your own:
---

::: warning 
Be sure to [install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your machine!

Knowledge of intellij or other editors with knowledge of java and
Gradle is required to configure the bot to your own.
:::

1. Open intellij idea and clone the repo using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DisBots-Studios-Inc/Melody-Bot.git
```

2. Click on the "run configurations" button and then edit configurations

3. Now click on the run configuration (or make one, setting the main class to the Main class)

4. Set an environment variable called TOKEN= and put your token there!

### How do I get my bot token ü§î?
---
1. First go to [this website.](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and log into your discord account.
2. Next make a new application, name it.
3. Fill out the details of your bot and give it an image(optional)
4. Go to the "Bot" tab and create a bot and give it an image(optional).
5. click on the "Copy Token" button, and you have your token!

::: danger
A bot token is like a password! Never upload it or share it with anyone!
Or else someone could log in with your bot and use it for malicious purposes.
:::

The next few updates are going be minor ones but are going to lay the foundation
for the new releases! You can see the original release for this update on [github](https://github.com/DisBots-Studios-Inc/Melody-Bot/releases/tag/v0.1.1b) and the original [original pull request here.](https://github.com/DisBots-Studios-Inc/Melody-Bot/pull/1)

Thanks for reading and we will be back soon with 0.3.0b!
