# The Music update! v0.3.0b First release candidate!

After a long awaited wait (wow, I can't phrase sentences)! The first release candidate for
v0.3.0b is here! A LOT of game changing features were added, such as **music!**, finnaly
the core feature of the bot is in! But since this a release candidate, we can't garentee that it is
100% bug free. In fact here are the known bugs:

```
1. Messed up colors in somethings
2. stop command is kinda messy
3. help command needs a revamp
4. need to fix and enable youtube search
```

::: tip
If you can fix these bugs right now before us, then head over to the
[Github page](https://github.com/DisBots-Studios-Inc/Melody-Bot) and open a pull request!
:::

Before we get into the features,I regret informing you that the youtube search 
for the Play command isn't in working condition yet. It will be added in rc 2.
But for now for all the new features are:
```
1. Better help command
2. Better botInfo command
3. Better ping command
4. Added music (play and stop command) currently only plays one song
5. Better Github command
6. Better Uptime command
7. Added utilities for color pallet
8. Added custom animated emoji support.
9. Completely overhauled logger
```

As you can see a lot of features were added! most likely tomorrow, we are going to
release v0.3.0b-rc2 and then 0.3.0b. As always here is the original [tag.](https://github.com/DisBots-Studios-Inc/Melody-Bot/releases/tag/v0.3.0b-rc1)

Thanks!
